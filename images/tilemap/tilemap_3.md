This image is a classic isometric asset sheet (tilemap) designed for a retro-style simulation or city-builder game. The art style is reminiscent of early 2000s titles like *SimCity 2000* or *RollerCoaster Tycoon*.

### **Technical Specifications**

* **Image Dimensions:** 1024 x 1024 pixels.
* **Sprite Dimensions:** The grid is non-uniform, but the primary base tiles appear to be **64 x 64 pixels** or **128 x 128 pixels** for larger structures.
* **Color Palette:** A mix of metallic grays, vibrant greens/blues for the "eco" dome, and a large section of UI/terrain markers in a neon gradient.

### **Sprite Categories & Descriptions**

#### **1. The Eco-Dome / Arcology (Top Row)**

These are the largest and most detailed sprites in the set.

* **Description:** A massive, tripod-legged metallic structure supporting a glass dome. Inside the dome is a miniature ecosystem with green hills, a small blue lake, and brown rock formations.
* **Animation Series:** This is a **12-frame animation**. If you look closely at the dome's base, there are blue lights or rotating panels that shift slightly in each frame, suggesting a slow rotation or "active" power state.

#### **2. Infrastructure & Small Tech (Second Row)**

This row contains smaller logistical assets:

* **Small Satellites/Sensors:** A series of tiny blue and silver dishes on tripods. These appear to be 32 frames of a slow **rotation animation**.
* **The "Gate" or "Toll":** A small gray rectangular structure with a light on top, followed by various states of a thin gray line (likely a retractable barrier or laser fence).
* **The Red Suspension Bridge:** Several segments of a red cable-stayed bridge. This is a **static series** used for building linear paths; it includes different angles and connection points.

#### **3. Terrain & Directional Markers (Bottom Left/Center)**

This large block consists of isometric "diamonds" or "wedges."

* **Primary Blue Diamonds:** A set of 4x8 diamonds in varying orientations. These likely represent water tiles, selection cursors, or zone markers.
* **The Gradient Series (The "Rainbow" Block):** This is a massive collection of wedges that transition through the color spectrum (Gray → Green → Yellow → Red → Pink → Purple → Blue).
* **Is it an animation?** No. This is likely a **functional series** for a "heat map" or "data overlay" (e.g., showing pollution levels, land value, or traffic density) in the game.
* **Shapes:** Each color contains a full set of slopes and angles to match the terrain height of the game world.

### **Summary of Animated vs. Static Series**

| Asset | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Eco-Dome** | **Animation** | To show the building is powered on/active. |
| **Satellites** | **Animation** | A simple looping rotation. |
| **Red Bridge** | **Static Series** | Modular pieces to build bridges of any length. |
| **Color Wedges** | **Functional Series** | UI overlays to represent data across varying terrain heights. |

### **Next Steps**

Would you like me to **extract specific sprites** from this sheet and save them as individual transparent PNGs for use in a game engine, or perhaps **generate a similar style building** to expand this set?
